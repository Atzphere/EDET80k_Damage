    "# Simulation Overview\n",
    "Because shooting the chip in the chamber with the laser at annealing power is a tedious and permanent process, it should ideally be done only with a clear goal in mind i.e. as a part of an experiment. To aid in gaining familiarity with the thermal properties of the chip and the annealing process, we've developed an approximate thermal simulation of the chip with a strong suite of tools for simulating lasing actions and analyzing the results. The simulation library is spread across multiple modules, with the centerpiece being *simulationlib*:\n",

    "The simulation works by solving the heat conduction equation in 2D using an explicit finite difference method. On top of conduction, we then simulate radiative cooling and any active laser flux. Effects such as conduction to the block holding the chip and its varying thickness are not simulated, making it more of a qualitative tool for learning and rapid prototyping. Most importantly, it's a valuable tool for verifying the intended behavior of annealing patterns before committing to having them fired at the chip. With some modification and experimentation, one could use it to also aid in searching parameter space for functional annealing pulses.\n",
